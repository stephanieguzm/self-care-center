# Self Care Center
## Mod 1 Solo Project
A Turing School of Software and Design project.

## Project Overview
For my Mod 1 solo project, I designed an application that allows a user to receive an affirmation or mantra message. Upon page load, users can select a type of message and a random affirmation or mantra is shown to the user. More information can be found in the Features section below.

## Technologies Used
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

## Features:
- User is given option to choose affirmation or mantra message upon page load
- Random message from selected option is generated upon user button click
- Option to clear message upon user button click. User view returns to meditation bell image with radio button selection cleared
- Option to delete a message upon button click if user does not like it. User view returns to meditation bell with radio button selection cleared

## Setup Instructions
* At the top of the repository, click the green Code button
* Copy the `SSH` link in the pop-up window: `git@github.com:stephanieguzm/self-care-center.git`
* Open your terminal and navigate to the directory you want to save the repository in.
* On your command line execute the following commands to open the game:
 * `git clone git@github.com:stephanieguzm/self-care-center.git`
 * `cd self-care-center`
 * `open index.html`
* Receive an encouraging message!

## How to Receive a Message
* When the browser opens the page, you will be presented with two message options: Affirmation or Mantra
* You must select a message option, otherwise you will get an alert to select a message to move forward
* Select a message type and click the *Receive Message* button
* A random message will display
* You are then given the option to *clear* the message from the screen and choose a new message
* Or, if you don't like your message, you can delete it by clicking *I don't like this Message*
* Once you click the *Clear* or *I don't like this Message" buttons, the page resets and you can select a new message option
